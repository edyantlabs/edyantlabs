**Open-source research for embodied AI in the physical world.**

## About
Edyant Labs is the open-source arm of Edyant, focused on embodied AI and for real-world robotics. We build research-grade frameworks that keep responsible AI grounded in context, consequences, and human needs.

Our work targets human-robot interaction where perception, memory, and ethics shape safe behavior in physical environments. We publish frameworks, benchmarks, and experiments so others can test, extend, and build on this work collaboratively.

### Our Vision

Today, most AI systems act as tools: they respond to inputs, optimize outputs, and leave humans to interpret consequences.

Edyant is working toward something different.

We believe physical AI systems — robots, devices, and intelligent environments — must:
- Understand the humans they interact with
- Adapt behavior across age, culture, and context
- Operate with ethical constraints, not just performance goals
- Maintain continuity, memory, and identity over time
- Take ownership of actions in the physical world

Our goal is to transition AI from **reactive tools** to **responsible agents**.

### The Four Frameworks
#### Ethics & Morals
Ethics & Morals equips embodied AI with value-based reasoning for real-world trade-offs. It helps physical AI balance safety, dignity, autonomy, and efficiency and explain the values behind action choices. This is foundational to responsible AI in robotics.

#### Persistence & Continuity
Persistence & Continuity treats memory as lived experience in physical AI. It enables long-horizon memory, skill retention, and accountability across deployments, so embodied AI improves over time without repeating the same mistakes. Continuity is essential for trust in human-robot interaction.

#### Socially Aware Interaction
Socially Aware Interaction adapts embodied AI behavior to human diversity, context, and environment. It emphasizes safe spacing, adaptive communication, and respectful pacing in real-world interaction. The goal is inclusive, humane robotics that meets people where they are.

#### Sensor-Grounded Awareness
Sensor-Grounded Awareness anchors physical AI in multimodal perception beyond vision. It enables situational awareness through sound, motion, proximity, and environmental cues so embodied AI acts with real-world context. This grounding is critical for safe, transparent robotics.

### Why It Matters
Embodied AI operates in homes, hospitals, workplaces, and public spaces. Mistakes are physical, not abstract. Responsible AI for robotics must reason about context, adapt to human needs, and remain accountable for real-world outcomes.

### Open-Source Ethos
Edyant Labs is open by design. We welcome collaboration, critical feedback, and contributions that strengthen embodied AI and human-robot interaction. Use the frameworks, test them in new environments, and share improvements back with the community.
